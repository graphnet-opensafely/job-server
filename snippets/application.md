**You should ONLY fill in this form if you require access to information on the OpenSAFELY-EMIS/-TPP COVID-19 research platform,
which has been established by NHS England and NHSX; NHS England is the data controller.**

Please complete ALL sections;
email the completed form to amir.mehrkar@phc.ox.ac.uk.
If you require assistance in completing the form,
please contact the email above and a member of the team will contact you.

More information describing the available datasets can be found under the [data sources section](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/dataset-intro/);
a notebook listing the available dataset tables is [here](https://github.com/opensafely/database-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/database-schema.ipynb);
the latest dataset import dates is described [here](https://github.com/opensafely/database-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/database-builds.ipynb).
Further information regarding the platform can be found [here](https://docs.opensafely.org/).

**All outputs from the OpenSAFELY-EMIS/-TPP NHS England COVID-19 research platform must be aggregated data with small number suppression applied.
OpenSAFELY operates as a trusted research platform;
no record level data is permitted to be extracted from the platform.
At this time, studies must not release any information (e.g. name, listsize) that identifies,
or could identify, STPs, Local Authorities, CCGs and individual GP practices.**

### Publication of results

NHS England oversees final approval for all publication ready papers or reports to check the outputs align with the stated application purpose,
and has been extremely supportive of all research and analyses to date;
particular note may be given to the content of service evaluations sponsored by NHS England.
The usual response time for approval is 1 week.

Following approval, as part of the [principles you are signing up to](https://www.opensafely.org/about/),
we expect you to make all study definition code, codelists, and results released from the platform (with disclosure controls applied)
public at or before the time when results are shared;
and papers are submitted for peer review publication.
To support the change in culture towards open science OpenSAFELY will automatically make public the GitHub repository
(to include the study definition code, codelists and released results)
12 months after any code has been executed against the pseudonymised patient records.

In addition, OpenSAFELY will create a public dashboard listing all approved studies:
description of purpose;
contact email of researcher;
affiliated organisation;
when first code run
link to GitHub repository
(to be made public at most 12 months after first code executed, and in almost all cases at the time of results dissemination);
links to published material (supplied by researchers);
this is supplementary to the live audit log of all analyses.

### Creating your study definition code

All applicants should attempt the [getting started guide](https://docs.opensafely.org/getting-started/)
to familiarise themselves with the minimum steps needed to run an OpenSAFELY-compliant study against randomly generated patient data.
**If your application is approved**, please use our [Q&A forum](https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/discussions) for support.
Once your study definition code is ready to run against the patient data,
you will execute it via our [Jobs server](https://jobs.opensafely.org/jobs/) (described [here](https://docs.opensafely.org/en/latest/job-server/)),
access to which is established once we invite you to join our OpenSAFELY GitHub organisation repo.
